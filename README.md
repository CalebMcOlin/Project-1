# Project 1 (Banking Application)

## Description:

The Banking Application will function as an emulation of a real-world banking system. Core features are available for
end users, such as creating accounts, making deposits and withdrawals from a userâ€™s accounts, and applying for loans.

Managers have access to all of the above functionalities, as well as the ability to approve loans and view all accounts
in the Banking Application.
